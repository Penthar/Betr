## Sign in and Registration

When entering the app, you will encounter the **"Sign In"** page. If you do not already have an account, register a new one using your e-mail address.

## Edit Screen

Here, you may manage your workout. Creation, editing and deletion of workouts are all done in this screen. Create a new workout using the **"Add workout"** button,
or change an existing one by clicking on its icon.

Using the app, you may input data about your exercise such as:
- Exercise name
- Number of repetitons
- Number of sets
- Rest time
- Set duration.

You may also see a graph representing your progression in either weight lifted or
Exercise score calculated using the weight, number of repetitions and sets and rest time between sets
(credits to jjoe64's [GraphView](https://github.com/jjoe64/GraphView) library for these graph objects).

(The graph is zoomable and scalable and will automatically update once changes have been made to your exercsie data).



## Timer screen

When starting your workout, select it in the Timer screen and press **""Start Timer""**. This will cause your workout's timer to begin,
and will automatically tell you which exercise to start, along with the weight, number of repetitions and rest time.
once the rest is over, it will tell you to start the next set. 
You may see all of the data for your exercises in this screen, but all the important details will be presented to you via 
notifications - for the duration of your workout, you don't have to enter the app!

## Import screen

You may add to your workout list any of the three preexisting workouts via this screen, or recieve any other workout using the "Workout Code" feature.
Just have a friend send you their workout's code, and paste it in the window.

## Map screen

To add a little spice to your progress towards your fitness goal, I added a little game to the app.
In this game, you need to defeat different characters that get progressively stronger, and the way you can do that is by increasing your fitness score,
i.e increasing the weight you lift, the number of repetitions or reducing rest time!
